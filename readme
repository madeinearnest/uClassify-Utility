Description:

A quick sketch bookmarklet that uses the uClassify free text classifier web service ( http://www.uclassify.com/ ) so you can classify web pages as you view them. Still rough, it just spits out the xml results. At some point I'll add a visualization and streamline the usability.

Using it:

Download the source, pop open uclassify.php and swap in your URL API read key. Also change the server path to your uclassify.php file in the bookmarklet link tag in bookmarklet.html.
